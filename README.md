Design

### Using Dead Keys for All Symbols

Cons:

- Each period, comma, and whatever else common symbol that you use will all 
take two keystrokes.
- Any behavior involving modifier key + symbol will not work through the dead 
key. 
- This is hard/impossible to setup on Windows and MacOS.
- If you need dead keys for international symbols, you'd be using the worse Compose key which
takes three keystrokes total. Although we do have three dead key types (grave,
tilde, acute) so hopefully you don't run out lol.
- High learning curve
- Some browsers don't respect .XCompose (Firefox LTS on Debian). It does work
in Brave though.

This is a tradeoff for:

- Significant increase in accuracy
- Fingers stay at/near homerow

Things to take note of:

- Vim keybinds and any application keybinds with symbols still work as long
as it's the symbol alone. This means typing ":" in vim through dead keys
still bring up the command line. In some websites however, this is finicky. 
(Discussed later)

Found inside `.XCompose`

### Number Layer

`Modifier_key + number` such as `Ctrl + 1` won't work with this layer. A workaround
would be to have a Colejak variant. A.k.a you switch layouts everytime you want to
use to `Modifier_key + number` and switch back. 

> [!NOTE]
> On Sway, you can add `Mod5` to your config. `Mod4 + 1` -> `Mod4 + Mod5 + 1`

Found inside `symbols/colejak`

### Navigation Row

We've now essentially brought the number row to the home row. This unlocks
a whole row for remapping. What better keys to map than to place navigation-related
keys here. Pros:

- Layout agnostic hjkl movemet + Home/End (no more getting confused with gg and G!).
- Arrow keys enable vim motions in **ALL** applications and textboxes.
- Vim motions in insert mode(??? for the lazy a.k.a me)

Especially within textboxes, here are available motions beyond hjkl:

- Word skipping - `Control+arrow`
- Start/End of a line - `Home` / `End`
- Start/End of textbox - `Control+Home` / `Control+End`
- Visual mode  - Hold shift while doing all the goodies above.

FAQ
---

### What are dead keys and Compose keys?

Dead Keys and the Compose Key are special "combo keys" that allow you to type 
a character by combining multiple key presses. Dead Keys are two-combo keys, 
commonly used for international symbols and diacritical marks, and come in types 
such as grave, tilde, and acute, which should not be confused with the standard 
grave and tilde keys. When pressed followed by a letter, they produce a special 
character, like `dead_tilde + n` outputting `Ã±`. Unlike the Shift key, which modifies 
the next key press only when held down simultaneously, Dead Keys modify the next 
key press even after they've been released.

### How do I take full advantage of this layout?

- Use vim motions in your editor
- Install vimium in your browser
- Use a tiling window manager
- Install warpd

You'd reach for the mouse maybe 1-20 times a week. And if you're on a
laptop, the trackpad is within thumb's reach. Guaranteed productivity
gains.

### Recommended Practice Routine

I did it in 3 weeks just typing my brains out,
averaging 100 wpm after 50 hours of typing tests. Here's how:

- Monkeytype English until 50 wpm average.
- Keybr. Apply these settings: 
    - 60 wpm target speed. 
    - Unlock next key only when the previous keys are also above the target speed. 
    - Beat all letters.
- Monkeytype `English 5k` until 80 wpm average.
- PR 132 wpm on `Monkeytype English`.
- Diversify wordsets
    - Monkeytype `code rust` for numbers and symbols
    - Monkeytype `quotes`
    - Monkeytype `code javascript` for common programming words

### Does this apply to TTY as well?

No. And I don't recommend doing anything this complicated to your TTY
settings... ***here be dragons***

Motivation
----------

I don't have money for a $400 ergonomic keyboard. Also, maximizing ergonomics
within the constraint of an ANSI layout means that this is guaranteed to work and feel better
on an ortholinear, split, or whatever keyboard as is.

### KCX Qwerty

- [ KCX Qwerty ][kcx-qwerty] is my old layout. Improved with modifier/special keys closer to the homerow.
This instead extends the default `symbols/us(basic)` layout which some may find useful.
